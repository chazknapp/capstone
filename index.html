            <h2>About This Project</h2>
        
            <p>
             This project explores how tornado behavior across the United States has evolved since the mid-20th century. 
              By comparing data decade by decade, it examines where tornadoes occur, how their frequency and intensity 
              have changed, and how human impacts have shifted over time. The visual and data-driven approach helps reveal 
              long-term patterns that are often hidden in raw numbers.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              The idea for this project came from a curiosity about the changing geography of Tornado Alley. 
              Many reports claim that the country’s most active tornado corridor is moving east, but I wanted to test that idea using 
              real data rather than speculation. Using NOAA storm records and Esri analysis tools, I worked to create an evidence-based 
              story that connects historical data, environmental change, and population exposure into one clear picture.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>
              The data show that tornado behavior has changed in measurable ways since the 1950s:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Activity is shifting eastward</strong> - Tornado counts have leveled off in the Great Plains but have increased sharply in the Southeast and Midwest.</li>
              <li><strong>Storms are generally weaker</strong> - The share of strong EF3+ tornadoes has declined across all regions, even as total counts have gone up.</li>
              <li><strong>Casualties are more concentrated</strong> - Deaths and injuries have dropped overall but remain higher in the Southeast, where dense populations, heavy tree cover, and nocturnal storms increase vulnerability.</li>
              <li><strong>Seasonality is broadening</strong> - The Plains show a small but noticeable increase in cool-season activity, meaning tornadoes are less limited to the spring months.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              These trends show that the nation’s tornado risk is no longer confined to one central Alley, but instead covers a broader and shifting landscape of storms and impacts. 
              The Southeast now experiences the greatest human toll, while the traditional Plains corridor has become quieter but still plays an important role in the overall pattern. 
              Understanding this eastward transition, and the environmental and social factors driving it, is vital for future preparedness, forecasting, and awareness.

            <h2>Tornado Alley Shift</h2>
            <h3>Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Tornado Activity in the United States, 1950–2025</h3>
        
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              This project examines how tornado activity across the United States has evolved over the past seventy-five years, focusing on long-term shifts in both strength and geographic distribution. 
              Using NOAA’s official tornado event database from 1950 to 2024, I conducted spatial and temporal analyses to determine whether the traditional Tornado Alley in the Great Plains still represents the nation’s main tornado corridor, or if the area of highest activity has shifted eastward toward the Southeast and Midwest. 
              Previous research has identified similar eastward trends, connecting them to changes in storm environments, atmospheric moisture, and large-scale climate variability (Cao et al., 2021; Gensini &amp; Brooks, 2018; Coleman et al., 2024). 
              Building on these findings, I used ArcGIS Pro to generate decade-by-decade kernel density (KDE), tessellation, and centroid analyses, supported by data preprocessing in Python and RStudio. 
              The results show that tornadoes were generally stronger in the 1950s and 1960s, while more recent decades have produced more frequent but weaker events that are spreading east into more densely populated areas. 
              This transition suggests that while the Plains remain an active region, the geographic center of tornado risk has migrated east, particularly into parts of the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. 
              The final output, an interactive web application, allows users to compare tornado activity by decade, revealing how environmental and social factors shape changing tornado risk across the United States.

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The goal of this project was to analyze the long-term spatial and temporal patterns of tornado activity in the United States and determine whether Tornado Alley has shifted eastward over time. 
              The project was motivated by recurring claims that tornado frequency is increasing in the Southeast while declining in the central Plains, a trend supported by recent climatological studies (Coleman et al., 2024; Gensini &amp; Brooks, 2018). 
              I sought to verify these assertions using consistent spatial methods, transparent data cleaning, and reproducible analysis across all decades from 1950 through 2024. 
              By visualizing trends through GIS rather than relying solely on statistical summaries, the project makes complex data more intuitive and relatable to both researchers and the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              The completed analysis reveals that tornadoes were historically concentrated across the Great Plains but have progressively expanded eastward, especially into the Mississippi Valley and Southeast. 
              While the number of strong tornadoes (EF3 and above) has decreased, total tornado counts have increased, reflecting a rise in weaker events and improvements in detection and reporting (Brooks, 2013). 
              These patterns underscore a critical shift in where the highest tornado risk now lies and highlight the importance of understanding how environmental change and human exposure interact over time. 
            </p>
        
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>
              The project was created for a broad audience, including meteorologists, geographers, emergency management professionals, educators, and the general public. 
              Its purpose is to demonstrate how spatial data analysis can bridge the gap between technical research and public understanding. 
              The interactive web application enables anyone to explore tornado history visually, compare decades, and see the eastward migration of activity firsthand. 
              It also serves as a professional portfolio project showcasing the integration of database management, GIS modeling, and front-end web development.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Project Goals and Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Evaluate whether Tornado Alley has shifted eastward from 1950 through 2025 using objective spatial methods.</li>
              <li>Analyze long-term changes in tornado strength, frequency, and geographic spread by decade.</li>
              <li>Develop a publicly accessible web interface that allows dynamic decade comparison using KDE, tessellation, and centroid visualization.</li>
              <li>Contextualize findings through peer-reviewed research on climate, severe weather environments, and tornado climatology.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Literature Review</h3>
            <p>
              Studies over the past two decades have increasingly pointed toward an eastward shift in U.S. tornado activity. 
              Cao et al. (2021) examined multi-decade tornado data and linked the redistribution of tornado frequency to increasing low-level moisture, which enhances storm potential in the Southeast. 
              Similarly, Gensini and Brooks (2018) found statistically significant spatial trends indicating a decline in tornado counts across the central Plains and an increase across the Midwest and Deep South. 
              Brooks (2013) explained that as temperatures rise, instability may increase but shear can decrease, leading to more frequent but weaker tornadoes. 
              Coleman et al. (2024) confirmed these regional and seasonal changes, identifying a shift toward more cold-season tornadoes in the Southeast. 
              Dixon et al. (2011) argued that Dixie Alley should not be considered distinct from Tornado Alley, but rather part of a continuous, eastward-evolving corridor of risk. 
              These findings provide the theoretical basis for this study, which visualizes and quantifies these transitions through GIS-based spatial analysis.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>
              This project combines multiple technical domains, data science, GIS modeling, and web development, to examine changes in tornado activity from both statistical and spatial perspectives. 
              The methods were carefully designed to ensure reproducibility, comparability, and clarity across all decades of data.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</h4>
            <p>
              The analysis used NOAA’s Storm Events Database, which contains every recorded tornado event from 1950 through 2024, including its coordinates, EF/F-scale rating, injuries, fatalities, and property damage estimates. 
              Raw CSV tables were downloaded and preprocessed in Python, using pandas, and RStudio for cleaning, filtering, and attribute generation. 
              Inconsistencies across decades were resolved by unifying the F and EF scales and standardizing event locations to the WGS 1984 coordinate system. 
              Events without geographic coordinates were omitted to preserve accuracy. 
              Each event was assigned a “Decade” field, 1950s–2020s, and a “Region” classification, Plains, Midwest, or Southeast, based on state boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because reporting standards have evolved substantially over time, particularly after the adoption of Doppler radar and the EF scale, normalization was necessary to compare decades fairly. 
              Data cleaning included removing duplicates, filling missing intensity fields when corroborated by other sources, and verifying all coordinates against the continental U.S. extent. 
              These standardized datasets were exported as shapefiles and imported into ArcGIS Pro for spatial modeling.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Spatial Analysis in ArcGIS Pro</h4>
            <p>
              Three main spatial analysis techniques were applied to visualize and quantify the eastward migration of tornado activity:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)</strong> - KDE surfaces were generated for each decade using identical cell size and search radius parameters to map tornado density consistently. These maps highlight clustering patterns and allow comparison between decades. High-density regions in the 1950s and 1960s were concentrated in Kansas and Oklahoma, while later decades show a clear shift toward the Tennessee and Mississippi Valleys.</li>
              <li><strong>Tessellation Grids</strong> - A hexagonal tessellation was applied across the contiguous United States to summarize tornado counts within equal-area cells. This method provides unbiased spatial comparison and reveals changes in intensity and frequency without influence from administrative boundaries. Separate vector layers were created for each decade and later integrated into the web app as interactive vector tiles.</li>
              <li><strong>Centroid Shift Analysis</strong> - Centroids were calculated for each decade to trace the spatial center of tornado activity over time. To control for uneven data reporting and incomplete decades, each centroid was derived from the first five years of every decade, for example 1950–1954, 1960–1964, and so on, with 2020–2024 representing the current period. This approach ensures temporal consistency and minimizes bias caused by partial datasets. The resulting centroid path illustrates a steady east-southeast migration from central Oklahoma in the 1950s toward northern Mississippi by the 2020s, confirming similar conclusions reached by Gensini and Brooks, 2018, and Cao et al., 2021.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              Statistical summaries were created for each region and decade. Linear regression models were used to estimate the rate of change in tornado counts per decade. 
              The results showed growth of approximately +36.7 tornadoes per decade in the Southeast, +22.3 in the Midwest, and +7.4 in the Plains, closely aligning with published estimates by Coleman et al., 2024. 
              Additionally, the proportion of strong tornadoes, EF3+, has steadily declined since the 1950s, supporting Brooks’ (2013) observation that environmental conditions now favor weaker, more frequent events. 
              Seasonality analysis also revealed that tornado activity in the Southeast increasingly occurs during the cool season, consistent with the findings of Dixon et al., 2011.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Web Application Development</h4>
            <p>
              The interactive web component was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the ArcGIS JavaScript API. 
              Three visualization modes, KDE, Tessellation, and Points, were created, each linked to decade-based layers hosted on ArcGIS Online. 
              Users can select two decades simultaneously and activate a vertical swipe tool for comparison. 
              Optional toggles display centroid paths and hotspot overlays. 
              The interface defaults to the 1950s layer but dynamically updates based on user input, allowing interactive exploration of tornado migration. 
              The application was tested locally using MAMP and Visual Studio Code, with version control maintained through GitHub. 
              By integrating all visualizations into a single, intuitive interface, the app makes academic-quality spatial data approachable for public learning.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>
              Spatial and statistical results confirm a measurable eastward shift in U.S. tornado activity since 1950. 
              KDE outputs show declining intensity in the Plains and increasing density across the Southeast. 
              The tessellation grids demonstrate a redistribution of tornado counts toward states such as Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. 
              Centroid paths provide clear visual confirmation, showing steady east-southeast movement across seven decades. 
              Regression analyses reinforce these patterns, quantifying significant growth rates per decade in eastern regions. 
              The observed decline in strong tornadoes, EF3+, corroborates Brooks’ (2013) and Cao et al.’s (2021) findings that changing environmental factors, including reduced vertical shear, influence storm intensity. 
              Collectively, these results indicate that Tornado Alley is no longer a fixed geographical feature but a dynamic and evolving corridor of risk.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Outcomes and Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
              The results support the conclusion that the center of tornado activity in the United States has shifted eastward over the past seventy-five years. 
              While the Plains remain part of the country’s storm corridor, the frequency, casualty risk, and societal exposure have increased more rapidly in the Southeast and Midwest. 
              This trend reflects a combination of climatic and demographic factors, including warming temperatures, increased atmospheric moisture, urban expansion, and higher population density in tornado-prone regions. 
              The completed web application effectively transforms these quantitative findings into an interactive narrative, allowing users to visualize patterns that were once buried in raw data tables. 
              By merging GIS with accessible web technologies, this project demonstrates the power of spatial analysis for communicating environmental change to a wide audience.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Recommendations for Future Development</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Update the analysis with data through 2030 and re-compute centroids using the standardized five-year approach for consistency.</li>
              <li>Integrate atmospheric indices such as CAPE, shear, and precipitation anomalies to examine meteorological drivers of observed trends, Gensini &amp; Brooks, 2018.</li>
              <li>Incorporate socioeconomic and infrastructure data to assess vulnerability in high-risk regions, Coleman et al., 2024.</li>
              <li>Enhance mobile and accessibility features and host the web application on a public cloud environment.</li>
              <li>Expand collaboration with climatologists and emergency management agencies to translate findings into actionable preparedness strategies.</li>
            </ul>
