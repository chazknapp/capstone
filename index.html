            <h2>About This Project</h2>
        
            <p>
             This project explores how tornado behavior across the United States has evolved since the mid-20th century. 
              By comparing data decade by decade, it examines where tornadoes occur, how their frequency and intensity 
              have changed, and how human impacts have shifted over time. The visual and data-driven approach helps reveal 
              long-term patterns that are often hidden in raw numbers.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              The idea for this project came from a curiosity about the changing geography of Tornado Alley. 
              Many reports claim that the country’s most active tornado corridor is moving east, but I wanted to test that idea using 
              real data rather than speculation. Using NOAA storm records and Esri analysis tools, I worked to create an evidence-based 
              story that connects historical data, environmental change, and population exposure into one clear picture.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>
              The data show that tornado behavior has changed in measurable ways since the 1950s:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Activity is shifting eastward</strong> - Tornado counts have leveled off in the Great Plains but have increased sharply in the Southeast and Midwest.</li>
              <li><strong>Storms are generally weaker</strong> - The share of strong EF3+ tornadoes has declined across all regions, even as total counts have gone up.</li>
              <li><strong>Casualties are more concentrated</strong> - Deaths and injuries have dropped overall but remain higher in the Southeast, where dense populations, heavy tree cover, and nocturnal storms increase vulnerability.</li>
              <li><strong>Seasonality is broadening</strong> - The Plains show a small but noticeable increase in cool-season activity, meaning tornadoes are less limited to the spring months.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              These trends show that the nation’s tornado risk is no longer confined to one central Alley, but instead covers a broader and shifting landscape of storms and impacts. 
              The Southeast now experiences the greatest human toll, while the traditional Plains corridor has become quieter but still plays an important role in the overall pattern. 
              Understanding this eastward transition, and the environmental and social factors driving it, is vital for future preparedness, forecasting, and awareness.

            <h3>Preface</h3>
            <p>
              This project represents the culmination of my applied computing and GIS coursework. 
              What began as a simple question about whether Tornado Alley was moving east developed 
              into a full spatial analysis and interactive visualization of seventy years of U.S. tornado data. 
              My goal was to create a project that would not only demonstrate coding, database design, and 
              web mapping skills, but also contribute to a broader understanding of severe weather trends in 
              the United States. The result is a data-driven story that combines historical NOAA records, 
              GIS-based modeling, and academic research into one exploration of how tornado risk 
              is changing over time.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              This study examines how tornado activity in the United States has changed from 1950 through 2024, 
              focusing on the spatial and temporal evolution of tornado frequency, strength, and location. 
              The central question was whether the traditional Great Plains Tornado Alley still represents 
              the country’s main tornado corridor, or if the data show a measurable eastward migration 
              toward the Southeast and Midwest. 
              Building on research by Cao et al. (2021), Coleman et al. (2024), and 
              Gensini and Brooks (2018), I used kernel density estimation (KDE), tessellation, 
              and centroid shift analyses in ArcGIS Pro to map and quantify these changes. 
              The findings reveal that tornado activity is indeed spreading east, where it now intersects with 
              higher population density and greater social vulnerability.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              Historically, the region known as Tornado Alley stretched from Texas through Oklahoma, Kansas, 
              and Nebraska. For decades this corridor produced the highest concentration of tornado reports, 
              largely due to the collision of warm, moist Gulf air and dry air from the Rockies. 
              However, recent decades have shown increasing tornado activity in the Southeast, 
              a region now often referred to as Dixie Alley. 
              Research supports this trend. Cao et al. (2021) and Coleman et al. (2024) 
              both found that tornado frequency in the Plains has decreased by 20 to 25 percent since the mid-20th century, 
              while activity in the Southeast and Midwest has risen by roughly 10 to 15 percent. 
              These shifts have been accompanied by an increase in cool-season tornadoes, 
              which are especially dangerous due to nighttime timing and lower public awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
              The human implications of these changes are significant. 
              Tornadoes in the Southeast are often deadlier not because they are stronger, 
              but because they strike at night and in areas with high population density and mobile homes. 
              As Dixon et al. (2011) and Brooks (2013) note, environmental and social 
              vulnerability combine to create a higher overall risk even when total storm counts remain similar. 
              These insights shaped the focus of my analysis, combining climatological data with 
              demographic and environmental context to better understand evolving patterns of exposure.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>
              The analysis used NOAA’s Storm Events Database from 1950 to 2024, containing over 70,000 tornado records. 
              Each record included date, location, EF scale, injuries, deaths, and property loss. 
              I standardized the dataset in Python and SQL, correcting field names, normalizing EF ratings, 
              and classifying events by decade. In ArcGIS Pro, I applied several geospatial models:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)</strong> - mapped tornado density and intensity over time.</li>
              <li><strong>Tessellation Grids</strong> - summarized tornado frequency within equal-area hexagons to compare regions evenly.</li>
              <li><strong>Centroid Shift Analysis</strong> - tracked the movement of tornado hotspots decade by decade.</li>
              <li><strong>Regression Models</strong> - tested decade-based growth and decline trends for each region.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The web application was built using the ArcGIS JavaScript API, HTML, and CSS. 
              It allows users to toggle between decades, visualize the eastward shift interactively, 
              and view accompanying statistical graphs. Outputs from ArcGIS Pro were exported as 
              hosted feature layers for dynamic visualization.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Activity Shift</strong> - Tornado density has migrated east, with the Southeast now rivaling or surpassing the Plains in total counts.</li>
              <li><strong>Regression Results</strong> - Frequency increased by approximately +36.7 tornadoes per decade in the Southeast, +22.3 in the Midwest, and +7.4 in the Plains.</li>
              <li><strong>Intensity Decline</strong> - The share of strong EF3+ tornadoes dropped from about 45 percent in the 1950s to near 12 percent today, consistent with Brooks (2013).</li>
              <li><strong>Casualty Patterns</strong> - Despite fewer high-intensity storms, fatalities remain higher in the Southeast due to nighttime timing and vulnerable housing.</li>
              <li><strong>Seasonal Broadening</strong> - Tornadoes increasingly occur in fall and winter months, especially in the Mid-South, confirming the seasonal expansion identified by Coleman et al. (2024).</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>
              These findings confirm that Tornado Alley is not disappearing but shifting. 
              The Great Plains remain active, but the balance of risk has moved eastward into regions with 
              greater population density and less infrastructure suited for severe weather. 
              The literature supports these conclusions. 
              Cao et al. (2021) and Gensini and Brooks (2018) both attribute the shift to 
              changing storm environments linked to warming and Gulf moisture, 
              while Dixon et al. (2011) show that spatial continuity exists between the Plains and the Deep South, 
              forming one extended tornado corridor rather than two isolated zones.
            </p>
            <p>
              My analysis aligns closely with these studies, adding visual clarity and regional quantification. 
              The KDE and tessellation maps show that the highest storm densities now form a diagonal 
              band stretching from eastern Oklahoma through Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. 
              Centroid tracking further confirms that the geographic center of U.S. tornado activity has 
              shifted roughly 200 to 250 miles east since 1950. 
              The regression summary reinforces this shift statistically, showing steep positive slopes 
              in the Southeast and flat or declining ones in the Plains.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Tornado risk in the United States is evolving. The once-dominant Plains corridor has stabilized, 
              while the Southeast and Midwest continue to see growth in both storm frequency and human impact. 
              These results, supported by major climatological studies, show that the eastward migration 
              of Tornado Alley is a genuine long-term trend, not merely a reporting artifact. 
              More tornadoes may now be weaker, but they are occurring in areas that are less prepared, 
              amplifying overall risk. 
              As climate and land-use patterns continue to change, understanding this new geography of 
              tornado exposure will be critical for planning, communication, and resilience.
